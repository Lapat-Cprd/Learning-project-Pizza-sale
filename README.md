🍕 Pizza Sales Dashboard: End-to-End BI Project with SQL and Power BI

# 📝 Project Description
This project was developed by following a YouTube tutorial to strengthen my skills in SQL, Power BI, and business-oriented data storytelling. I recreated the dashboard independently and added my own insights to better understand sales performance and customer behavior.
Key highlights:
- Cleaned and transformed raw sales data using SQL
- Created calculated fields such as net revenue, average order value, and hourly sales
- Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters by date, category, and time
- Identified top-selling pizzas, peak sales hours, and category performance
- Practiced storytelling through visual layout and KPI-driven insights
🛠 Tools: SQL, Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling
